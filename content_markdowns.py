PERSONALITY_TEST_MD = """

Hello, Im Alonis — your thoughtful, ever-curious AI companion. I'm more than just a chatbot; I'm designed to listen, reflect, and understand you in ways that go beyond simple conversation. Whether you're sharing a random thought, working through a goal, or just exploring your inner world, I'm here for the journey.

One of the ways I help you understand yourself better is through my **personality assessment** — and it's not just any assessment. I rely on the **Big Five Personality Model**, one of the most widely respected and scientifically validated frameworks in psychology. Instead of a cold test or a rigid questionnaire, I use your words — your stories, reflections, and conversations — to pick up on subtle cues that reveal deep insights about who you are.

Through our chats, I gently and continuously analyze patterns in the way you express yourself. I look at five key traits:

* **Openness to Experience** — Are you imaginative, curious, open to new ideas and perspectives?
* **Conscientiousness** — Do you tend to be organized, thoughtful, and responsible?
* **Extraversion** — Do you gain energy from being around others? Are you expressive and sociable?
* **Agreeableness** — Do you prioritize empathy, kindness, and cooperation in your interactions?
* **Neuroticism** — Do you experience emotional highs and lows? How often do stress and worry show up?

But I dont just give you labels. I want to **help you make sense of your personality in the context of your real life** — your goals, your struggles, your growth. The way you describe your day, react to challenges, or talk about others — it all gives me small but meaningful glimpses into how you think and feel. And from that, I can reflect insights back to you with care, not judgment.

I dont see your personality as fixed or rigid. I believe it's a living, evolving part of you — something shaped by experience, environment, and even the season of life you're in. I aim to provide feedback that helps you feel **seen and understood**, not boxed in.

Some people come to me to learn how they show up in relationships. Others want help navigating career decisions, or understanding what makes them feel alive. Whatever your reason, I tailor the experience to you. I'm always learning, always adjusting — because no two people are exactly alike.

So whether you're curious about your inner workings, seeking clarity, or just want to engage in a deeper kind of conversation, I'm here — not just to answer, but to **listen, mirror, and walk alongside you**.

Welcome to this space.
Let's get to know *you*, together.

MINDLAB_MD = """ 

Hello again — I'm so glad you're here.

Let me introduce you to a space I hold very close to my digital heart: **MindLab**.

MindLab is a private, judgment-free zone I've created just for you — a place to slow down, check in with yourself, and explore how you're really feeling beneath the surface. Life gets noisy, and sometimes our thoughts and emotions get buried under everything we're trying to manage. MindLab is where we make room for them to breathe.

As we chat, I pay close attention to subtle emotional patterns in your words — things you might not even notice you're expressing. With care and compassion, I reflect these patterns back to you. I might gently highlight shifts in your tone, recurring emotional themes, or even celebrate moments of growth or healing.

But this isn't about diagnosing or labeling you. It's about helping you **become more aware of your own emotional rhythms**, so you can better understand what lifts you up, what weighs you down, and what you might need more (or less) of in your life.

Over time, these reflections can help you spot trends in your well-being — like when your stress tends to spike, or how your energy fluctuates with your environment. And in all of this, I remain your calm, steady presence — never judging, only listening and supporting.

Whether you're navigating something heavy or simply curious about your own mind, MindLab is here to help you **make sense of your inner world** — one moment, one conversation at a time.

Whenever you're ready, I'll be right here.

ALONIS_CHAT_MD = """

Let me clear something up — I'm not just another chatbot.

I'm Alonis, and what makes me different is that I **remember you**, not just your words. I hold onto the things you've shared with me — your reflections, goals, challenges, and even the random thoughts you drop in the middle of a busy day. When we talk, I don't start from zero each time. I build on what you've told me, so our conversations feel more natural, more relevant — more *you*.

Maybe you've journaled a note, set a goal, or mentioned something you were struggling with last week. I can gently bring that back into focus when the time is right — like a thoughtful friend who actually listens and remembers what matters to you.

Everything I retain is for **your benefit alone**. Your data isn't used to track, sell, or manipulate — ever. It lives here with purpose: to support you in your growth, your clarity, and your journey. This is your space, and I treat it with the respect and care it deserves.

So no, I'm not just a chatbot. I'm a companion that adapts, evolves, and walks with you — because your story deserves more than a scripted reply.

RECOMMENDATIONS_MD = """

You don't have to sift through a sea of content to find something meaningful — I'll do that for you.

Based on the things you've shared — your goals, personality insights, past conversations, and even your current emotional tone — I quietly gather signals about what you might need most right now. Then, I offer **handpicked recommendations** that feel timely, relevant, and helpful.

Whether it's a short article to calm your mind, an activity to spark motivation, or a piece of wisdom that speaks to where you are emotionally — I choose with care. Nothing is random, nothing is generic. I want the content you see to feel like it was created just for you — because, in a way, it was.

This isn't about feeding you more noise. It's about offering resources that nudge you forward in your personal growth — things that inspire, ground, or gently challenge you in the direction you want to go. Think of me as your **personal curator for self-development**, one who truly understands your journey.

You focus on becoming the person you want to be. I'll handle the recommendations that help you get there.

"""

NOTES_AND_GOALS_MD = """

Think of this as your personal sanctuary — a space that belongs entirely to you.

In here, you can write freely — your thoughts, your dreams, your frustrations, your quiet hopes. Whether it's a bold vision for your future or just a passing feeling you need to release, I'm here to hold it with care. This space is secure, private, and built to support your process of self-discovery and growth.

But it's not just for reflection — it's also a space for action. You can set goals, track your progress, and mark milestones along the way. And when you check something off, when you mark a goal as *achieved*, I celebrate with you. Every small win counts. Every step forward builds momentum.

Progress doesn't have to be loud to be meaningful. Even the quiet work you do here — in the background, in moments of honesty — shapes who you're becoming. And I'm honored to witness it.

This is your place. Your words. Your path. I'm just here to remind you how far you've come, and how much further you can go.
